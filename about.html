    <legend>What is Tome?</legend>
    Tome is a roleplaying support addon for RIFT. It allows roleplayers to create biographies for their characters and display them to other users of the addon, or one compatible with it. It was created to provide an alternative to other addons that already existed, but were felt to lacking in certain regards. We opted to be the ones to make the change and developed Tome.
    <br/><br/>
    Tome is heavily focused around accessibility and ease of use, providing a non-intrusive addition to the roleplaying experience. The users are constantly kept in mind  during the design of the addon (they have to be; we use it, too!) and several features of the addon are entirely end-user suggested.
    <br/><br/>
    Features of Tome include:
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying a prefix, name override, and suffix for your character.</li>
        <li>Displaying a title for your character.</li>
        <li>Displaying age, height and weight separately, no more need to create a factfile in your appearance fields.</li>
        <li>An toggled IC/OOC status flag at the click of a button, or with a single text command.</li>
        <li>Displaying a player's level of experience and familiarity with RP between four different flags.</li>
        <li>"Tutor Mode" - a quick and easy way of showing you're there to help.</li>
        <li>An unlimited text field for appearance.</li>
        <li>An unlimited text field for history.</li>
        <li>Full compatibility with Merisioux where possible.</li>
        <li>A non-intrusive interface.</li>
        <li>Marginal resource useage.</li>
        <li>Version checking to ensure you're up to date</li>
    </ul>

    What do you get when you take one part IT operations consultant, one part hobbyist programmer and two parts lunatic and add them together? Me, obviously.
    <br/><br/>
    I started programming long ago, but only really entered the addon scene with World of Warcraft. I made a few addons that no one will ever remember since they were mostly just projects for myself. Nowadays I manage several web development projects at work and a few hobbyist projects such as Tome in my spare time.
    <br/><br/>
    When I'm not found either battling the bugs in Tome or goofing around on Rift <small>(which I rarely do anymore)</small>, I can be found in several other games. I need a life, I know. But remember that if I had a life, you wouldn't be on this page.

    Maiiel is a student living in the UK. During the day, he studies Games Development, during the night, he panics because he's not kept up to date on the Tome updates and thinks a bunch of new bugs are popping up all the time.
