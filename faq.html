<h3>General Questions</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What is Tome?</legend>
    Tome is a roleplaying support addon for RIFT that allows players to add and display additional information about their characters such as appearance, prefixes/suffixes, and background.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Is Tome compatible with Merisioux?</legend>
    Yes.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Will Tome interfere with any other addons?</legend>
    No.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Can I run Tome and Merisioux at the same time?</legend>
    Yes, but users who are only running Merisioux may experience display issues when viewing your data, especially if you are transmitting data from both addons.
    <br/><br/>
    Tome does pretty much everything that Merisioux does, so there's not really much point in running both addons together, anyway.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Can I test Tome?</legend>
    Yes. You can download it <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">here</a>.
</div>
<div class="well">
	<legend>Can I contribute to Tome?</legend>
	If you would like to contribute to the development of Tome, please contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> in game.
</div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What's Tutor Mode?</legend>
    Tutor Mode is a quick and easy way for RPers to broadcast themselves as willing to help out beginner roleplayers. If an inexperienced roleplayer sees the tutor flag, they know they can come to that person with any questions or ask for advice.
    <br/><br/>
    As such, we would suggest that you only toggle on Tutor Mode if you're willing to be helpful and beneficial to new roleplayers in showing them the ropes and answering their questions.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What are the RP flags?</legend>
    The RP flags, or the experience flags, are the items contained within the dropdown menu on the character edit pane. These are used to display your experience and familiarity with RP.
    <br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Non-Roleplayer</b><br/>Pretty self explanatory here.</li>
        <li><b>Fledgling Roleplayer</b><br/>This is for newer roleplayers, either to RP as a whole, or possibly just RIFT. These are the guys Tutor Mode is designed to help.</li>
        <li><b>Roleplayer</b><br/>You've been around roleplay enough to consider yourself a roleplayer, but you don't consider yourself to be experienced yet.</li>
        <li><b>Experienced Roleplayer</b><br/>You've been roleplaying enough to know the ins and outs, the etiquette and the places to be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="well">
	<legend>Why do some users have coloured names?</legend>
	Coloured names represent users who have contributed to the development of Tome. These users are testers, coders, graphic designers, anyone who has we feel been a significant help to the construction of this addon, and who have wished to be acknowledged.
</div>	
<div class="well">
	<legend>Why doesn't Tome use the extensive flag system?</legend>
	The decision not to use the extensive flag system was a design choice agreed upon by both developers. We feel that an extensive flagging system would contradict our focus on ease of use and confuse newer roleplayers.
</div>
<div class="well">
	<legend>Why doesn't Tome use the meta field?</legend>
	The decision not to use the meta field was a design choice agreed upon bt both developers. Both Maiiel and Zhevron come from a roleplaying background where a meta field was not used. We do not feel it is necessary, and do not want to have to add it into our UI.
	<br/><br/>
	At a pinch, we're sure you can just at a small OOC declaration in your appearance or histories to convey the information you wished to.
</div>
<h3>Common Issues</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Why are the Guild and Settings tab empty?</legend>
    Both the Guild tab and Settings tab have not yet been given any features. The buttons are merely there as placeholders until we finish up the content for those tabs.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>The dropdown menu is overlapped by the text area! I can't select the option I want.</legend>
    This is an error in an older version of Tome. To fix it, please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">download</a> the latest version.
	<br/>
	If you have the latest version, please create an <a href="https://github.com/zhevron/Tome/issues">issue</a> in the issue tracker, or contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> in game.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Why isn't there text wrapping in the Edit Pane? You have it in the View Pane.</legend>
    It's physically, metaphorically, literally, figuratively and theoretically impossible for us to add text wrapping into the Edit Pane. This is a limitation on the addon resources we are given by Trion.
    <br/>
    Manually entering line breaks and indents work just fine and will be displayed correctly in the Edit Pane, however.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>My friend says they've updated their Merisioux. Why can't I see the changes in Tome?</legend>
    Due to the way Tome handles data queries, cached data from Merisioux must expire before new data is fetched. Data in the cache expires after one hour.
	<br/>
	It is possible to force the cache to clear by typing the command <i>"/tome clear"</i> into the chatbox ingame. This will clear all data from the cache, meaning Tome will fetch new data at the next query.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>I can't type in the Appearance or History fields!</legend>
    This is an error in an older version of Tome. To fix it, please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">download</a> the latest version.
	<br/>
	If you have the latest version, please create an <a href="https://github.com/zhevron/Tome/issues">issue</a> in the issue tracker, or contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> in game.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend><b>x</b> feature isn't working! What can I do?</legend>
    Look for a workaround in the command line by typing "/tome help" into the chatbox in game. If you can't find a workaround, contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> with the issue and they'll either help you get it sorted, or make a note of the bug and add it to the list of stuff that needs to be fixed.
    <br/><br/>
    We're not perfect.
