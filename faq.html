<h3>General Questions</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What is Tome?</legend>
    Tome is a roleplaying support addon for RIFT that allows players to add and display additional information about their characters such as appearance, prefixes/suffixes, and background.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Is Tome compatible with Merisioux?</legend>
    Yes.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Will Tome interfere with any other addons?</legend>
    No.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Can I run Tome and Merisioux at the same time?</legend>
    Yes, but users who are only running Merisioux may experience display issues when viewing your data, especially if you are transmitting data from both addons.
    <br/><br/>
    Tome does pretty much everything that Merisioux does, so there's not really much point in running both addons together, anyway.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Can I test Tome?</legend>
    Yes. You can download it <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">here</a>.
</div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What's Tutor Mode?</legend>
    Tutor Mode is a quick and easy way for RPers to broadcast themselves as willing to help out beginner roleplayers. If an inexperienced roleplayer sees the tutor flag, they know they can come to that person with any questions or ask for advice.
    <br/><br/>
    As such, we would suggest that you only toggle on Tutor Mode if you're willing to be helpful and beneficial to new roleplayers in showing them the ropes and answering their questions.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>What are the RP flags?</legend>
    The RP flags, or the experience flags, are the items contained within the dropdown menu on the character edit pane. These are used to display your experience and familiarity with RP.
    <br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Non-Roleplayer</b><br/>Pretty self explanatory here.</li>
        <li><b>Fledgling Roleplayer</b><br/>This is for newer roleplayers, either to RP as a whole, or possibly just RIFT. These are the guys Tutor Mode is designed to help.</li>
        <li><b>Roleplayer</b><br/>You've been around roleplay enough to consider yourself a roleplayer, but you don't consider yourself to be experienced yet.</li>
        <li><b>Experienced Roleplayer</b><br/>You've been roleplaying enough to know the ins and outs, the etiquette and the places to be.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Common Issues</h3>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Why are the Guild and Settings tab empty?</legend>
    Both the Guild tab and Settings tab have not yet been given any features. The buttons are merely there as placeholders until we finish up the content for those tabs.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>The dropdown menu is overlapped by the text area! I can't select the option I want.</legend>
    The current beta build of Tome (0.2-beta) has not been updated with this fix yet. A workaround is available, however. Firstly try typing "/reloadui" into the chatbox in game.
    <br/><br/>
    If that doesn't solve your issue, you can force Tome to display the option you want via command line. Type "/tome set flag <b>x</b>" into the chatbox in game, where the <b>x</b> is the experience level you want, as follows:
    <br/><br/>
    0 = Non-Roleplayer<br/>
    1 = Flegling Roleplayer<br/>
    2 = Roleplayer<br/>
    3 = Experienced Roleplayer<br/>
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Why isn't there text wrapping in the Edit Pane? You have it in the View Pane.</legend>
    It's physically, metaphorically, literally, figuratively and theoretically impossible for us to add text wrapping into the Edit Pane. This is a limitation on the addon resources we are given by Trion.
    <br/>
    Manually entering line breaks and indents work just fine and will be displayed correctly in the Edit Pane, however.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>I updated my Tome and clicked save. Why can't my friend see my changes?</legend>
    In the current version of Tome (0.2-beta) updates are not broadcast when the save button is pressed, they are only saved locally. In order for your updates to be seen, the viewer must clear their Tome cache by either waiting an hour for the cache to refresh or by manually clearing the cache by typing "/tome clear" into the chatbox in game.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>I can't type in the Appearance or History fields!</legend>
    When trying to select the Appearance or History fields, make sure that you click on the top line. Clicking anywhere else while the field is blank will not enable the field.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <legend>Tabbed indents give me an error / move the cursor an extra space forward.</legend>
    This is an error in an older version of Tome. To fix it, please <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">download</a> the latest version.

    If you have the latest version (uploaded 15th July), please create an <a href="https://github.com/zhevron/Tome/issues">issue</a> in the issue tracker, or contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> in game.

<div class="well">
    <legend><b>x</b> feature isn't working! What can I do?</legend>
    Look for a workaround in the command line by typing "/tome help" into the chatbox in game. If you can't find a workaround, contact <i>Maiiel@Faeblight</i> with the issue and they'll either help you get it sorted, or make a note of the bug and add it to the list of stuff that needs to be fixed.

    We're not perfect.
