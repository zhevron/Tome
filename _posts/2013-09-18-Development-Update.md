title: Development Update (September 2013)

As some of you might actually be interested in knowing what goes on inside our heads at the moment, I'd like to take a moment to let you know what's being worked on and what's not.

**Guild Support**  
I know this is likely one of the most anticipated features Tome will ever have to offer and therefore I've decided to prioritize the development of it. There are a few technical roadbumps on the way, but we're getting there. The preliminary concept allows anyone with the *write to addon storage* permission to edit the guild data.
As you can probably tell from the previous statement, Tome will utilize guild storage for the data. This will require a small bit of it (or large, depending on how much you decide to write) and could potentially be limited even more if your guild has a lot of data already stored from addons like guild calendars and whatnot.
Initially, the interface for guilds will allow you to set a name override, a *subtitle*, a description and a miscellaneous field. There will also be toggle buttons for recruitment status and whether your guild does roleplay or not. If you're interested in knowing more, the interface concepts are available [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Zbeh4YW7DzEaH_Y6kxIlLw6jHHCSnaa_8b0aeeJVeCg).

**Multiple Character Profiles**  
Yet another anticipated function that roleplay addons in several other games have had for ages: The possibility of having several pre-made profiles on the same character that you can swiftly switch to and from. It's currently not at the top of our priority list, but it's pretty high up there.
The thought it to add another dropdown menu to the Tome interface allowing you to switch to the profiles in an instant. This will of course utilize our broadcast update system to make sure all the Tome users around you instantly see when you've switched your profile.

**Field Tooltips**  
Ever wondered what those fields are? Asking yourself who would be stupid enough to add a million fields without any hints as to what they really are? Well, so are we.
And in light of that realization, we've decided to add mouseover tooltips to all fields with a short explanation what the purpose of the field is and maybe even some examples.
We hope this will provide a far better user experience when interacting with Tome's interface.

**Improved tracking of maximum allowed data size**  
Currently, Tome provides no message to the user when the data they have entered exceeds the maximum message size set by Trion. We intend to change this by adding a progress bar and some text to tell you how much you have left and if you've exceeded the limit.
I've not yet made a decision if we should disallow saving data that has been determined as larger than the limit or not, but it is a possibility.
This feature may be delayed until we move Tome to a better storage system.

There are also several optimization fixes incoming, but as an end user, you won't even notice them much. You can always see them in our patch notes, however.

That's it for the development update for now. If you have any questions, please direct them at Rhundas/Maiiel in-game or send them to me by mail.
