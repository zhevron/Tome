__Hey everyone!__  
Tome has just recieved a new beta update, with a absolute TON of bugfixes and features added. You can download it [here](http://tomeaddon.com/download.html).

### Features
* __Blacklisting__  
    _Tome can now hide any tooltips that you don't want to see. Blacklisting commands are available under "/tome help"._
* __Local Notes__  
    _You can now save notes for individual characters for later reference. This feature is accessed through the View Pane or is available via command line as listed under "/tome help"._
* __Currently Field__  
    _A new field intended for displaying information on something about your character to be immediately noticed._
* __Coloured Names__  
  _Certain individuals will now appear with coloured names. These colours represent those that have contributed to Tome in a significant way._
* __Updated Compatibility__  
    _Tome now receives the new fields from Merisioux._

### Bug Fixes
* __Broadcast Updates__  
    _Tome now correctly broadcasts saved changes and will display these changes correctly. No need to clear to cache to see them._  
__This does not apply to data recieved from Merisioux. The cache must still expire before new data is fetched.__
* __Version Checking Fix__  
    _The Tome Tooltip now displays the correct beta number, instead of one ahead._
* __Textfield Fix__  
_The textfield is now no longer picky about where you click it when it is empty and will be selected as the correct focus._
* __Scrollbar Fix__  
   _The scrollbar has run some laps and now correctly keeps up to the amount of text within editable fields._
* __Tooltip Fix__  
    _The Tome tooltip has been updated with a new courage algorithm. It now no longer runs offscreen when confronted by PvP flagged Merisioux users of the opposing faction. We agree, they're terrifying._
* __Dropdown Fix__  
   _The dropdown has recently overcome its overpowering shyness and is no longer hiding (badly) behind the Appearance Field._
